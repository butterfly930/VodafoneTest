User Management System using React and JSON Server
This project is a User Management System that allows users to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on a collection of users through a user-friendly web interface.

Features
User Table: The heart of the system is a table that displays a list of users. Each row represents an individual user, showing key details such as their name, email, and other relevant information.
Users of the system can perform CRUD operations on the user table:

Create: Add new users by filling out a form with their details such as name, email, etc.
Read: View the list of users with their information in a tabular format.
Update: Edit user details and save the changes.
Delete: Remove users from the system, ensuring data accuracy.
